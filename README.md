# Convertor tool for serbo-croation alphabets
Currently I work on some HUUUGE data mining project of mine, that will probably never end, but couple of good ideas, and tools, sprung out of it.
This is one of them, simple converter (convertor sounded more distinguish) for Cyrillic and Latin alphabet (into opposite, of course). It even have some nice features, like:

* no need to choose alphabet (auto-recognition),
* you can keep Latin text from converting if it’s inside Cyrillic text.

Tool is not well tested, so I’m sending it to beta testing, which means YOU!
